## Smart Medication Safety: Real-Time Drug Interaction Alerts via EHR Integration

## Project Overview

This project presents an AI-powered medication safety platform that addresses the growing risks of polypharmacy. The system integrates real-time drug-drug and drug-food interaction alerts into clinical workflows via HL7 FHIR-compliant EHR integration, and extends support to patients through a mobile application. The solution enhances both clinician decision-making and patient self-management.

The system combines a knowledge graph, natural language processing, and machine learning to deliver personalized, context-aware safety recommendations. It is designed for use across hospitals, clinics, and at home.

## Key Features

### Clinician Interface

- Integration with major EHR systems via FHIR standards
- Real-time medication interaction screening during prescribing
- Alerts based on patient-specific context (age, comorbidities, organ function)
- Recommendations for safer alternatives according to clinical guidelines

### Patient Mobile Application

- Barcode-based food and drug scanning
- Interaction alerts with dietary guidance
- Voice-enabled reminders and multilingual support (English and Chinese)
- Personalized safety tips and dosage schedules

### Intelligence Engine

- Knowledge graph built from DrugBank, FDA, and clinical literature
- NLP to translate medical warnings into plain language
- Severity-based risk classification and learning from real-world data
- Future extensibility with genomic data and wearable devices

## System Architecture

The system includes three tightly integrated components:

- A REST API layer backed by a graph-based knowledge engine (Neo4j)
- EHR integration modules for clinical environments (Epic, Cerner, etc.)
- A cross-platform mobile application developed using React Native

## Development Plan

- Months 1–3: Architecture design, knowledge schema, and UI prototyping
- Months 4–9: Backend development, mobile app creation, EHR integration
- Months 10–12: Laboratory and clinical testing
- Months 13–18: Pilot deployment and real-world validation

## Implementation and Use Cases

The software has distinct interfaces for clinicians and patients. Clinicians receive prescribing-time alerts and alternative suggestions. Patients scan items and receive real-time feedback about risks, substitutions, and instructions.

A built-in notification mechanism informs physicians when serious risks are detected, enabling them to take proactive action. For example, the system warns about the interaction between simvastatin and grapefruit juice and suggests safer substitutes such as orange juice.

The platform supports clinical queries using a Neo4j knowledge graph, allowing personalized recommendations based on genetic markers, lab results, and prescriptions.

## Business Model

The platform supports value creation for hospitals, clinicians, patients, insurers, and public health systems. Primary revenue channels include licensing to institutions, SaaS subscriptions, and insurer partnerships. Costs include development, clinical validation, database licensing, and regulatory compliance.

The system aims to reduce adverse drug events, optimize prescribing decisions, and improve adherence across a diverse patient population. It provides infrastructure for future digital health innovations in precision medicine, remote monitoring, and personalized care delivery.
